# Space.js
Next Generation Javascript. Releasing Spring 2024.

# Future Functionalities:
- Add a vareity of "Spaces" (Visual Components)
- Easy Deployments with
   - Vercel
   - Netlify (Currently Broken)
   - Koyeb
   - Codesandbox
   - Codepen
   - Replit
   - Mavic Cloud
   - Pretty much (Almost) anywhere.

- Frontend Framework
- Many Pre-Made plug-and-play Spaces
- Realtime Changes
- And more!!

# Current Capabilitiies
 - It literally just coexists in your project without errors and only shows the "HiBasic" space (On everywhere but CodeSandbox, there is literally nothing on the screens, so go ahead and file an issue if you find anything), but hey! Deployments work!

# Examples
 Alright so most are kind of empty rn but here.
- (Vercel, blank with no errors) https://spacejs-boilerplate.vercel.app/ 
- (CodeSandbox, Also only one that shows the "HiBasic" text component) https://fcycgv.csb.app/-
- (Netlify is Broken) https://spacejstest.netlify.app/
- 
- File an issue with another deployment for me to add to the examples.

# Updates
- 3/10/24 Initial Alpha V.01 Release
- More Coming Soon
